# Animal Control Dashboard Integration

This document explains the integration of animal control statistics with the dashboard page.

## Overview

The dashboard now displays real-time animal control catch statistics for felines and canines, showing:
- Total catches by species (feline/canine)
- Breakdown by gender (male/female)
- Current date display
- Only includes 'catch' records (excludes 'surrendered' records)

## Backend Changes

### Database Schema Updates
- Added `species` field to `animal_control_records` table
- Added `gender` field to `animal_control_records` table
- Both fields are optional to maintain backward compatibility

### New Endpoint
- **GET** `/animal-control-records/statistics/dashboard`
- Returns catch statistics grouped by species and gender
- Only includes records with `record_type = 'catch'`
- Response format:
```json
{
  "feline": {
    "male": 3,
    "female": 2,
    "total": 5
  },
  "canine": {
    "male": 8,
    "female": 4,
    "total": 12
  },
  "total_catches": 17
}
```

### Files Modified
- `backend/core/models.py` - Added species and gender fields to AnimalControlRecord
- `backend/core/schemas.py` - Updated schemas to include new fields
- `backend/routers/animal_control_records.py` - Added statistics endpoint

## Frontend Changes

### New Service Method
- `animalControlRecordService.getAnimalControlStatistics()` - Fetches statistics from backend

### New Hook
- `useAnimalControlStatistics()` - Manages state for animal control statistics

### Updated Components
- `DashboardPage.tsx` - Now uses real data for TotalCatchCard
- `TotalCatchCard` - Displays real catch statistics with male/female breakdown

### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/services/animalControlRecordService.ts` - Added statistics interface and method
- `frontend/src/hooks/useAnimalControlStatistics.ts` - New hook for statistics
- `frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` - Updated to use real catch data

## Features

### Real-time Data
- Dashboard displays actual catch counts from the database
- Updates automatically when new animal control records are added
- Only includes 'catch' records (not 'surrendered' records)

### Gender Breakdown
- Shows male/female distribution for each species
- Displays actual counts for each gender category

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback to zero values if data is unavailable
- Error messages displayed to users if API calls fail

### Responsive Design
- Maintains existing UI design while using real data
- Current date is dynamically displayed

## Database Requirements

The implementation requires:
- `animal_control_records` table with new `species` and `gender` columns
- Existing records will have NULL values for these fields
- New records should include species and gender information for accurate statistics

## Migration Required

To add the new fields to existing database:
```bash
cd backend
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add_species_gender_to_animal_control_records"
alembic upgrade head
```

## Testing

Use the provided test script to verify the endpoint:
```bash
python test_animal_control_stats.py
```

## Usage

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

2. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. Navigate to the dashboard to see real animal control catch statistics

## Data Entry

When creating new animal control records, include:
- `species`: "feline" or "canine" (or "cat"/"dog")
- `gender`: "male" or "female" (or "m"/"f")
- `record_type`: "catch" (for dashboard statistics)

## Future Enhancements

- Add date filtering for statistics
- Implement caching for better performance
- Add more detailed breakdowns (by breed, age, etc.)
- Include surrendered animals in separate statistics
- Create visual charts/graphs for better data representation
- Add export functionality for catch statistics
