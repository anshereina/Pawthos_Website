## ðŸ”„ Configuration Status

âœ… I've disabled `nixpacks.toml` so Railway will use auto-detection  
âœ… Your `Procfile` is ready  
âœ… Your `runtime.txt` specifies Python 3.10  
âœ… Your `requirements.txt` has all dependencies  

Railway will now automatically:
- Detect it's a Python project
- Install dependencies from requirements.txt
- Use the start command from Procfile
- Handle pip installation correctly

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "railway: command not found" after installation

**Solution:** Restart PowerShell or your terminal completely.

### Issue: Installation blocked by execution policy

**Solution:** Run PowerShell as Administrator and set execution policy:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Then try installing again.

### Issue: npm install fails

**Solution:** Install Node.js first from https://nodejs.org/
