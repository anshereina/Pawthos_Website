## ðŸ“‹ Complete Setup (With Environment Variables)

### Step 1: Install Railway CLI
```powershell
iwr https://railway.app/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Backend
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\DELL\OneDrive - Polytechnic University of the Philippines\Documents\Pawthos\backend"
```

### Step 3: Login to Railway
```powershell
railway login
```
*Browser will open for authentication*

### Step 4: Initialize Project
```powershell
railway init
```
- Project name: `pawthos-backend` (or whatever you prefer)

### Step 5: Add PostgreSQL Database
```powershell
railway add --database postgresql
```
*This automatically sets DATABASE_URL for you!*

### Step 6: Set Environment Variables

First, generate a secure secret key:
```powershell
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```
Copy the output, then run:

```powershell
# Replace with the generated secret key
railway variables set SECRET_KEY="paste-your-generated-secret-key-here"

# Replace with your actual email credentials
railway variables set SMTP_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
railway variables set SMTP_PASS="your-app-password"

# Set environment to production
railway variables set ENVIRONMENT="production"
```

**For Gmail SMTP Password:**
1. Go to Google Account â†’ Security
2. Enable 2-Step Verification
3. Create an "App Password" for "Mail"
4. Use that 16-character password

### Step 7: Run Database Migrations
```powershell
railway run alembic upgrade head
```

### Step 8: Deploy Your Application
```powershell
railway up
```

### Step 9: Generate Public Domain
```powershell
railway domain
```

Copy the URL that appears (e.g., `https://pawthos-backend-production.up.railway.app`)

```

Or use the provided script:
```powershell
python check_deployment.py https://YOUR_URL
```
