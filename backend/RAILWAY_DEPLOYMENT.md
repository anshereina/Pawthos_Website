## üöÄ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install Railway CLI

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
iwr https://railway.app/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

**Or using npm:**
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

### Step 2: Login to Railway
```bash
railway login
```
This will open your browser for authentication.

### Step 3: Navigate to Backend Directory
```bash
cd backend
```

### Step 4: Initialize Railway Project
```bash
railway init
```

Answer the prompts:
- **Project name**: `pawthos-backend` (or your preferred name)
- **Environment**: `production`

### Step 5: Add PostgreSQL Database
```bash
railway add --database postgresql
```

This creates a PostgreSQL database and sets the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable automatically!

### Step 6: Set Environment Variables
```bash
# Secret key for JWT
railway variables set SECRET_KEY="your-super-secret-key-min-32-characters-long"

# SMTP configuration
railway variables set SMTP_USER="your-smtp-email@example.com"
railway variables set SMTP_PASS="your-smtp-password"

# Environment flag
railway variables set ENVIRONMENT="production"
```

### Step 7: Deploy! üöÄ
```bash
railway up
```

That's it! Your backend is now deployed. Railway will give you a URL like:
```
https://pawthos-backend-production.up.railway.app
```

## üìã Detailed Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Deploy from CLI (Recommended)

#### 1. Prepare Your Project
```bash
cd C:\Users\DELL\OneDrive - Polytechnic University of the Philippines\Documents\Pawthos\backend
```

#### 2. Install Railway CLI
```powershell
# PowerShell (Run as Administrator)
iwr https://railway.app/install.ps1 -useb | iex

# Verify installation
railway --version
```

#### 3. Login
```bash
railway login
```

#### 4. Create New Project
```bash
railway init
```

#### 5. Add PostgreSQL Database
```bash
railway add --database postgresql
```

Railway automatically:
- Creates a PostgreSQL instance
- Sets `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Connects your app to the database

#### 6. Configure Environment Variables

```bash
# View current variables
railway variables

# Set required variables
railway variables set SECRET_KEY="generate-a-secure-32-char-min-secret-key"
railway variables set SMTP_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
railway variables set SMTP_PASS="your-app-password"
railway variables set ENVIRONMENT="production"
```

**Generate a secure SECRET_KEY:**
```python
# Run in Python
import secrets
print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))
```

#### 7. Run Database Migrations
```bash
# Railway provides the DATABASE_URL, so just run migrations
railway run alembic upgrade head
```

#### 8. Deploy Your Application
```bash
railway up
```

Wait for deployment to complete. You'll see:
```
‚úì Build successful
‚úì Deployment live at https://your-app.up.railway.app
```

#### 9. Generate Public Domain
```bash
railway domain
```

This creates a public URL for your API.

---

### Option 2: Deploy from GitHub (Alternative)

#### 1. Push Code to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Railway deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

#### 2. Create Railway Project
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose your `Pawthos` repository
5. Select the `backend` folder as root directory

#### 3. Add PostgreSQL
1. Click "New" ‚Üí "Database" ‚Üí "Add PostgreSQL"
2. Railway automatically connects it to your app

#### 4. Configure Settings
1. Click on your service
2. Go to "Settings"
3. Set **Root Directory**: `backend`
4. Set **Start Command**: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`

#### 5. Add Environment Variables
1. Go to "Variables" tab
2. Add:
   - `SECRET_KEY` ‚Üí Your secure key
   - `SMTP_USER` ‚Üí Your SMTP email
   - `SMTP_PASS` ‚Üí Your SMTP password
   - `ENVIRONMENT` ‚Üí `production`

#### 6. Deploy
Click "Deploy" - Railway will automatically build and deploy your app.

## üîß Configuration Files Explained

### `railway.json`
Configures build and deployment settings for Railway.

### `Procfile`
Tells Railway how to start your application.

### `nixpacks.toml`
Specifies system dependencies and build phases.

### `runtime.txt`
Specifies Python version (3.10.12).

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### Automatic Setup (Recommended)
Railway automatically provides `DATABASE_URL` when you add PostgreSQL:
```bash
railway add --database postgresql
```

### Manual Connection String
If you need to check your database URL:
```bash
railway variables get DATABASE_URL
```

### Running Migrations
```bash
# Run migrations using Railway's DATABASE_URL
railway run alembic upgrade head

# Or connect to railway environment first
railway shell
alembic upgrade head
exit
```

### Access Database Directly
```bash
# Open PostgreSQL shell
railway run psql $DATABASE_URL

# Or use Railway's built-in database viewer
railway open
# Then click on PostgreSQL service
```

---

## üì¶ File Uploads & Storage

Railway provides **persistent volumes** for file storage!

### Enable Persistent Volume (If Needed)
```bash
railway volume create uploads
railway volume mount uploads /app/uploads
```

Your current `uploads/` directory will work perfectly on Railway! üéâ

---

## üåê Custom Domain (Optional)

### Add Custom Domain
1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. Click your service ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Networking
3. Click "Generate Domain" for Railway subdomain

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Build Fails
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check logs
railway logs

# Ensure requirements.txt is correct
railway run pip install -r requirements.txt

# Rebuild
railway up --detach
```

### Issue: App Crashes on Startup
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check logs for errors
railway logs

# Common causes:
# - Missing environment variables
# - Database connection issues

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify DATABASE_URL is set
railway variables get DATABASE_URL

# Check PostgreSQL is running
railway open  # Check PostgreSQL service status

# Run migrations
railway run alembic upgrade head
```

### Issue: CORS Errors
**Solution:**
Update `main.py` CORS configuration to include your Railway URL:
```python
allow_origins=[
    "https://your-frontend.vercel.app",
    "https://your-app.up.railway.app",
    "http://localhost:3000",
    "*"  # Remove in production
]
```
